          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This development project provided an avenue through which I was able
            to explore React useStates for web development. Tasked with
            implementing filter and sort functions and an aggregator, I decided
            to make a list application which utilizes aggregation to divide
            tasks between those on a to-do list and others on a will-do list.
            Users will be able to sort through their to-do task based on
            “Complete-by” and “Date added” dates. Meanwhile, they can use the
            filter function to view items based on their color or category
            assignments. Finally, the revert button will reset the application,
            allowing users to filter, sort and aggregate their list items as
            they see fit.

            <h3>Part I: Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              As the first step in the development process, I conducted
              competitive analysis to assess common aggregators and their
              implementations. I selected three different websites:
              <a
                href="https://www.goat.com/?utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=20931280770&utm_content=159171407033&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxOauBhCaARIsAEbUSQRNNdnASTJ4g7dX90w8q6wCYHjeNdtZwlmQQW-jUNKA4qmMWG02Hd8aAm8fEALw_wcB"
                >GOAT</a
              >,
              <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/54347/discussion/"
                >Ed Discussion</a
              >
              and <a href="https://www.asos.com/us/">ASOS</a>. I believed
              implementations for each would differ based on their differing
              purpose and user demographics. Below is a Competitive Comparison
              Chart that reflects my findings:

            <p>
              My experience analyzing the ASOS, GOAT and Ed Discussion
              favoriting features offered different experiences. ASOS is a
              fast-fashion retailer, GOAT is a sneaker, luxury apparel and
              accessory company and Ed Discussion is a university classroom
              discussion platform. ASOS’s website has a dedicated section for
              favorited items where they are displayed based on user-selected
              sorting criteria. Its location on the navbar coupled with these
              filtering options makes for simple website navigation. GOAT and
              ASOS’s dedicated favorites webpage share additional functionality
              including item previewing, editing and deletion, and quantity
              viewing. These filtering and editing options allow users to
              customize their cart to reflect their evolving purchasing plans.
              Moreover, Ed Discussion previews the title text for posts. Unlike
              ASOS and GOAT, Ed provides information on the section of the
              website from which a post came. This information allows users to
              efficiently identify pertinent webpage sections. However, GOAT and
              Ed’s absence of a favorites section from its navigation bar makes
              identifying these features on the website less efficient,
              learnable and memorable.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Based on these findings, I decided that my to-do list program
              should have the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dedicated Webpage</b> so users can efficiently access the
                list
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Number of items</b> to allow users to know the number of list
                items they have
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Item Preview</b> so users can easily view their list items
                without a click
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Sorting</b> so users can organize data based on their needs
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Filtering</b> to enable users to reduce the options they are
                considering
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Part II: Design Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              After settling on my program's features, I started sketching
              design ideas.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
              First, I decided to do 9, 1-minute sketches to explore different
              web layouts.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Scanned Documents.jpg" />
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
              Second, I decided on the layout I liked best and replicated my
              ideas on Figma.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Untitled.jpg" />
            <p>
              I decided on the left and right layout because I thought it would
              be most intuitive for American users. Additionally, I believed it
              enabled the webpage to display a signicant information about the
              website without forcing the user to scroll.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, I believed the contrast between colorful cards and a
              black and white background communicates a positivety that, while
              may not be present when someone is mired in work, is nice to
              engage with.
            </p>

        <div id="conclusion">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            While I have had prior experience using React, doing so completely
            independently for the first time offered a valuable learning
            experience. I found it particularly difficult to understand how to
            implement overlapping filtering functions. Through research,
            however, I was able to figure this out. Furthermore, ensuring that
            the data structures and graphical changes maintain consistent was a
            consistent bug I encountered.<br /><br />
            Had I had more time to expand on this program, I would have created
            a color customization and text editing feature to allow users to
            create and customize their own tasks. Overall, useStates and React
            items create more versatile programs and more optimized programming
            experiences.
